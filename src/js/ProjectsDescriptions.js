            I went through the process of configuring a NodeJS, Webpack, Babel app served via Express.
            I used it as the foundation for the React Clone. Going through that set up helped demistify Webpack and Node / Express setup, something that had always been done for me by my peers ❤.
            Now I can actually debug a Webpack config !
